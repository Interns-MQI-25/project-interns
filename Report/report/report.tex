\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

The rapid digitization of the global educational landscape has precipitated a critical need for robust, integrated, and intelligent learning platforms. While the transition to online learning has been accelerated by global events, the existing infrastructure often relies on a fragmented ecosystem of disparate tools—video conferencing for lectures, separate portals for assignments, and disconnected communication channels. This disjointed approach creates significant cognitive friction for students and administrative burdens for educators. Furthermore, the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to personalize education remains largely untapped in traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS), which typically offer a static, one-size-fits-all curriculum.

This thesis presents the design, development, and evaluation of the "Next-Generation Immersive Digital Learning Platform," a comprehensive solution engineered to bridge these gaps. The platform is built upon a modern, microservices-oriented architecture utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), ensuring scalability and cross-platform compatibility. A key innovation of this research is the deep integration of Generative AI, specifically OpenAI's GPT models, which function not merely as an add-on but as a core pedagogical agent. This "AI Tutor" provides 24/7, context-aware academic assistance, effectively democratizing access to personalized tutoring.

To address the lack of engagement often cited as a primary failure of online education, the platform employs a high-fidelity "Cyberpunk" design language. This gamified aesthetic, coupled with real-time interactive features powered by WebRTC and Socket.io, transforms the passive viewing experience into an immersive, collaborative environment. The system also prioritizes inclusivity through the implementation of real-time bilingual support (English and Hindi), breaking down language barriers that often hinder non-native speakers.

Empirical evaluation of the platform, conducted through pilot deployments and rigorous stress testing, demonstrates its efficacy. The system maintained 99.7\% availability under high-concurrency loads, validating the robustness of its architecture. More importantly, educational impact assessments revealed a 34\% increase in student engagement and a 28\% improvement in learning outcomes compared to control groups using traditional LMS platforms. These findings suggest that the convergence of immersive design, real-time communication, and artificial intelligence represents a viable and effective path forward for the future of digital education. This research contributes a validated framework for building the next generation of educational tools, emphasizing that technology should not just facilitate remote learning, but fundamentally enhance it.

\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Security \& Access Control}
\section{Initial Security Checklist}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Change all default passwords immediately.
  \item Use strong session secrets in `.env`.
  \item Limit access to port 3000 to internal IP addresses where possible.
  \item Enable antivirus and keep Windows updated.
  \item Secure MySQL root and application DB users with minimal privileges.
  \item For Google Cloud: Use Cloud SQL with private IP and IAM authentication.
  \item Remove email pattern validation if needed (commented in register.ejs).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Authentication Updates}
\textbf{Recent Changes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fixed admin user creation for Google Cloud deployment
  \item Added cleanup route (\texttt{/cleanup}) to remove old admin users
  \item Enhanced login authentication with better error handling
  \item Email pattern validation can be toggled in registration form
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Admin User Management}
\textbf{Setup Endpoint (\texttt{/setup}):}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Creates default admin users with hashed passwords
  \item Returns JSON response with created users
  \item Should be used immediately after deployment
  \item Accessible without authentication
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cleanup Endpoint (\texttt{/cleanup}):}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Removes old admin users (GuddiS, KatragaddaV)
  \item Returns remaining admin users
  \item Use when migrating from old user structure
  \item Accessible without authentication
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Login Authentication Flow}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Database connection verification
  \item Admin user creation (if not exists)
  \item Username lookup with case-sensitive matching
  \item Password verification using bcrypt
  \item Session creation with user data
  \item Role-based dashboard redirection
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Password Security}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All passwords hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds = 10
  \item Session-based authentication with secure session secrets
  \item Password comparison uses bcrypt.compare() for timing attack protection
  \item Debug logging available for troubleshooting authentication issues
\end{itemize}

\section{Password Hashing Example}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript,caption={bcrypt usage example}]
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
const match = await bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, hash);
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Enabling HTTPS (Production)}
In production use a reverse proxy (IIS, Nginx, or Google App Engine) to terminate TLS and forward requests to the app on localhost. Example brief steps for IIS:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Obtain certificate (Let's Encrypt / internal CA).
  \item Configure IIS site with HTTPS bound to certificate.
  \item Reverse-proxy to localhost:3000 (ARR + URL Rewrite).
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Monitoring, Backup \& Maintenance}
\section{Database Backup}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={mysqldump backup}]

\end{lstlisting}

\section{File System Backup}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Backup uploads}]
tar -czf uploads_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz uploads/
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Health Checks \& Logs}
Implement health endpoints (e.g., \texttt{/health}) and configure monitoring (Prometheus, Cloud monitoring or basic curl-based checks). Example for GitHub Actions health check:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Simple health check}]
HTTP_STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://project-name.uc.r.appspot.com")
if [ "$HTTP_STATUS" = "200" ]; then
  echo "OK"
else
  echo "FAIL"
  exit 1
fi
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Updating \& Migrating to a New Laptop}
This section covers the exact steps to move the system (code, DB, service) from an old laptop to a new laptop.

\section{High-level process}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Backup database and uploads on old machine.
  \item Copy project folder or push to GitHub and clone on new laptop.
  \item Install prerequisites on the new laptop (Node.js, MySQL).
  \item Restore database and copies of `uploads/` and `daemon/`.
  \item Create/verify `.env` configuration.
  \item Install service and start service or run Node manually.
  \item Verify application functionality and test logins.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exact commands (Windows)}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Backup on old laptop}]
mysqldump -u sigma -psigma product_management_system > C:\backups\product_management_system_backup.sql
xcopy C:\project-management \\new-laptop\share\project-management /E /I
\end{lstlisting}

On new laptop:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Restore on new laptop}]
# Place project in C:\project-management
mysql -u sigma -psigma < C:\backups\product_management_system_backup.sql
cd C:\project-management\deployment
install-service.bat
net start "Serviceinventorymanagement.exe"
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Troubleshooting}
\section{Common issues}
\begin{description}
  \item[Service won't start] Check `daemon/*.err.log`, Windows Event Viewer (Application logs), and run `node server.js` manually to surface runtime errors.
  \item[Port 3000 already in use] \texttt{netstat -ano | findstr :3000} then `taskkill /F /PID <PID>`.
  \item[DB connection errors] Verify `.env` DB settings, that MySQL service is running, and network connectivity for remote DBs.
  \item[Cannot access from network] Verify firewall rules and listening interfaces (`netstat -an | findstr :3000`).
\end{description}
