# File Attachment Feature Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Backend Infrastructure
- **File Upload Utility** (`src/utils/fileUpload.js`)
  - Multer configuration for handling file uploads
  - Support for images, documents, PDFs, text files
  - File size limit: 10MB per file, maximum 10 files per upload
  - File type validation and security checks
  - Database integration functions

### 2. Database Schema
- **New Table**: `product_attachments`
  - Stores file metadata and references
  - Links files to products
  - Tracks upload history and user info
  - SQL migration file: `sql/add-product-attachments.sql`

### 3. Backend Routes Added

#### Monitor Routes (`src/routes/monitorRoutes.js`)
- Updated `/add-product` route to handle file uploads
- `GET /download-attachment/:attachmentId` - Download files
- `GET /api/product-attachments/:productId` - Get file list
- `DELETE /api/attachment/:attachmentId` - Delete files

#### Admin Routes (`src/routes/adminRoutes.js`)
- `GET /admin/download-attachment/:attachmentId` - Download files
- `GET /admin/api/product-attachments/:productId` - Get file list
- `DELETE /admin/api/attachment/:attachmentId` - Delete files

#### Employee Routes (`src/routes/employeeRoutes.js`)
- `GET /employee/download-attachment/:attachmentId` - Download files
- `GET /employee/api/product-attachments/:productId` - Get file list (read-only)

### 4. Frontend Implementation

#### Monitor Stock Page (`views/monitor/stock.ejs`)
- Added file upload section to product creation form
- File preview functionality
- Files column in stock table
- JavaScript functions for loading and displaying attachments

#### Admin Stock Page (`views/admin/stock.ejs`)
- Files column in stock table
- File viewing and download functionality
- Delete attachment capability for admins

#### Employee Stock Page (`views/employee/stock.ejs`)
- Files column in stock table
- File viewing and download functionality (read-only)

### 5. Features Implemented

#### File Upload (Product Creation)
- Drag & drop file support (via form input)
- Multiple file selection
- File type validation (images, docs, PDFs, text)
- Real-time file preview with size display
- File removal before upload

#### File Management
- **View Files**: Click "View Files" button to expand file list
- **Download Files**: Direct download links for all file types
- **Delete Files**: Admin-only capability to remove attachments
- **File Icons**: Contextual icons based on file type
- **File Size Display**: Human-readable file sizes

#### Security Features
- File type validation (whitelist approach)
- File size limits
- Secure file storage in `/uploads/products/`
- User permission-based access control

## File Types Supported

### Images
- JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP

### Documents
- PDF
- Microsoft Word (DOC, DOCX)
- Microsoft Excel (XLS, XLSX)

### Storage
- Files stored in `/uploads/products/` directory
- Unique filename generation with timestamps
- Original filename preserved in database

## User Permissions

### Monitor Users
- Upload files during product creation
- View and download all attachments
- Cannot delete attachments

### Admin Users
- All monitor permissions
- Can delete any attachment
- Full file management capabilities

### Employee Users
- View and download attachments only
- Cannot upload or delete files

## Next Steps (To Complete Implementation)

1. **Database Migration**: Run the SQL migration to create the attachments table
2. **Test File Uploads**: Verify file upload functionality works
3. **Test Downloads**: Ensure file download works across all user types
4. **Production Deployment**: Update GAE deployment to include upload directory

## Technical Notes

- Uses `multer` for file upload handling
- Files are stored on the server filesystem
- Database stores metadata and file references
- Responsive design maintains mobile compatibility
- Error handling for file operations
- File cleanup on deletion
